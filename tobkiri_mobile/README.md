# Tobkiri Remote Mobile

Tobkiri Remote Mobile is the Flutter client for managing a PC-hosted Tobkiri
`defaultspack` from iOS and Android devices on a trusted network.

The app targets the Kernel Pack API on port `8765`, not the standalone
defaultspack chat transport on port `8766`. The Kernel API requires a bearer
token and is the safer surface for LAN access.

## PC Setup

Start Tobkiri with the Kernel API bound to the trusted LAN:

```powershell
$env:RUMI_API_BIND_ADDRESS="0.0.0.0"
python -m rumi_ai
```

Read the active API token from `tobkiri_runtime/user_data/hmac_keys.json` or run:

```powershell
cd tobkiri_runtime
python -c "from core_runtime.hmac_key_manager import HMACKeyManager; print(HMACKeyManager().get_active_key())"
```

In the app, set the server URL to `http://<pc-lan-ip>:8765` and paste the token.
Keep the PC firewall limited to your private network. Do not expose this port
directly to the public internet.

## Settings recovery

Settings are loaded independently from secure storage for the Kernel API,
paired device, notifications, and device identity. If one source cannot be
read, Tobkiri shows a redacted per-source diagnostic and Retry instead of
substituting editable defaults. Successfully loaded pairing and identity
details remain visible, while Save stays disabled until loading succeeds or
the user confirms safe recovery using only the loaded sections.

`Reset editable settings` is a separate confirmed action. It clears only the
Kernel API URL/token, refresh preference, and notifications. It never deletes
the paired-device record or device identity. A durable reset marker keeps an
interrupted reset in an explicit retry-required state instead of presenting
partially deleted values as a fresh installation.

When using Tobkiri Launcher, closing the window sends it to the background and
keeps the Kernel API available for remote clients. Use the tray menu's `Quit`
item when you want to stop the Kernel and exit Tobkiri completely.

Android debug/profile builds allow cleartext HTTP for trusted-LAN development.
Android release builds do not globally allow cleartext traffic; use HTTPS or an
explicit release network policy if distributing a LAN-only build.

## Development

```powershell
cd tobkiri_mobile
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

Android debug builds require a Flutter/Android SDK environment:

```powershell
flutter build apk --debug
```

iOS builds require macOS and Xcode:

```bash
flutter build ios --no-codesign
```
